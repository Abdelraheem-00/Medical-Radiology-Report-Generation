# 🏥 Medical Radiology Report Generation  

This project aims to **automatically generate medical radiology reports** from chest X-ray images using deep learning and natural language processing (NLP).  
The system leverages a **CNN-based image encoder** and a **transformer-based language decoder** to generate accurate and descriptive radiology reports that can assist radiologists in clinical diagnosis.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Automatic generation of radiology reports from medical images (e.g., chest X-rays).  
- ✅ Preprocessing pipeline for DICOM / PNG medical images.  
- ✅ Image encoder (CNN / Vision Transformer) for medical image feature extraction.  
- ✅ Report decoder (LSTM / Transformer / GPT-like) for text generation.  
- ✅ Evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr).  
- ✅ Easy-to-use inference script to generate reports for new images.
