# 🩺 Medical Radiology Report Generation

## 📌 Overview
Medical Radiology Report Generation is an AI-powered project designed to assist in **automatically generating medical radiology reports** from imaging data.  
The goal is to reduce the workload on radiologists, improve reporting efficiency, and minimize human errors by leveraging **machine learning and natural language processing (NLP)**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📷 **Medical Image Processing**: Handles radiology image data (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc.).
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Models**: Extracts key features from medical images.
- ✍️ **NLP-based Report Generation**: Automatically generates structured medical reports.
- 🌐 **Web Interface (React + Flask/Odoo backend)**: Simple and intuitive UI for uploading scans and receiving reports.
- 📊 **Customizable Reports**: Doctors can edit and approve generated reports.
